# 🏰 Bastion-Banner

**Bastion-Banner** is your terminal’s **welcome committee** 🎉.  
Every time you open a terminal, it greets you with a slick ASCII
banner and system info — no more boring shells.

## ✨ Features
- 🖼️ Custom ASCII banners for your distro

- 🎯 Ubuntu **and** Debian logos (Termux supported too!)
- ⚡ Zero update/upgrade — installs only what’s needed
- 🧹 Easy uninstall without breaking your `.bashrc`
- 🔮 Ready for more banner themes in future

---

## 📦 Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/linux-edu/Bastion-Banner.git

```

🎨 Banner Selection

When installing, choose your style:

Default → for Termux or other distros

Your choice is saved, and neofetch will run automatically at terminal start.

🗑️ Uninstall

Want to remove it? Easy:

```bash
cd Bastion-Banner
bash uninstall.sh
```
